Homework 3/9/16

For next class, create a new script based on read_genotypes.pl that calculates the percent similarity between two accessions based on their marker scores!

Additional Questions that can be answered using the same genotypes.txt file:
Does this percent similarity vary across different chromosomes? What chromosome is the most similar between the two accessions? The least similar?

Is one accession significantly more heterozygous than the other?

Which of the two accessions has the fewest variant alleles compared to the reference genome?

BONUS EXTRA CREDIT: A new file, '10genotypes.txt', has been added to this repository. Can you create a new version of your script that can compare 10 different genotypes, not just 2?
